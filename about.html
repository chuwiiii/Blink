       <p> BLACKPINK, a South Korean girl group under YG Entertainment, was formed in August 2016 with members JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, and LISA. 
        They auditioned to become trainees, aspiring to debut as recording artists. YG Entertainment explained that the name BLACKPINK goes beyond beauty, 
        challenging the notion that pink solely represents prettiness. It conveys the message that the group stands for more than just beauty; 
        it signifies the fusion of beauty and remarkable talent. <br>

while Rosé, who had topped the list among 700 Australian applicants in 2012, was the final member introduced on June 22, 2016. On June 29, YG Entertainment officially declared that 
BLACKPINK would consist of four members and revealed their name, which reflected their emphasis on talent over appearance.  BLACKPINK shared their first dance practice video on July 6,
