       <p> BLACKPINK, a South Korean girl group under YG Entertainment, was formed in August 2016 with members JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, and LISA. 
        They auditioned to become trainees, aspiring to debut as recording artists. YG Entertainment explained that the name BLACKPINK goes beyond beauty, 
        challenging the notion that pink solely represents prettiness. It conveys the message that the group stands for more than just beauty; 
        it signifies the fusion of beauty and remarkable talent. <br>

In 2011, YG Entertainment began preparing for BLACKPINK's debut with plans for a seven-member girl group to launch in early 2012.  Jennie was introduced as the first member 
on June 1, and Lisa, who had emerged as the sole candidate from a 4,000-person audition in Thailand in 2010, was revealed on June 8. Jisoo was announced as the third member on June 15, 
while Rosé, who had topped the list among 700 Australian applicants in 2012, was the final member introduced on June 22, 2016. On June 29, YG Entertainment officially declared that 
BLACKPINK would consist of four members and revealed their name, which reflected their emphasis on talent over appearance.  BLACKPINK shared their first dance practice video on July 6,
and YG Entertainment confirmed their debut date as August 8, 2016, on July 29. <br>

On August 8, 2016, Blackpink released Square One, their debut single album, with "BOOMBAYAH" and "WHISTLE". Blackpink became the fastest act to reach number one 
and two on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart and the third Korean artist to do it following labelmates Psy and Big Bang. 
Blackpink's first music show performance was on SBS's Inkigayo on August 14, 2016. They broke the record for the shortest time a girl group has
won on a music program after debuting by winning first on Inkigayo thirteen days after debuting. <br>
<br>
  Following their successful debut, BLACKPINK released their second single album, "Square Two," which included the tracks "PLAYING WITH FIRE" and "STAY," on November 1, 2016.
 "Playing with Fire" also reached number one on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, and notably, it became the first K-pop girl group song to chart on the Canadian Hot 100. <br>
<br>
BLACKPINK's commercial achievements in their initial five months earned them multiple rookie awards at major Korean year-end music award ceremonies, such as the Asia Artist Awards, 
Melon Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart Music Awards. Furthermore, Billboard recognized them as one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016. <br>

On January 17, 2017, BLACKPINK introduced their fan club, known as "Blink," which is a combination of "black" and "pink." <br>
<br>
On June 22 of the same year, the group released their first standalone digital single, "AS IF IT'S YOUR LAST." This song swiftly rose to the top spot on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart just one day 
after its release, marking their third number-one hit on the chart. The accompanying music video for the song set new records, becoming the most-liked music video by a Korean girl group on YouTube and the 
most-viewed K-pop group music video within the first 24 hours of release. <br>
<br>
Subsequently, on July 20, 2017, BLACKPINK held a showcase at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, which drew more than 14,000 attendees, with an astonishing 200,000 individuals attempting to secure tickets. 
The group made their Japanese debut on August 30, 2017, with a self-titled Japanese extended play that included Japanese versions of their previous singles. The EP achieved remarkable success, 
debuting at the top of the Oricon Albums Chart. <br>
